OpenFLUID-WaresHub
==================

OpenFLUID-WaresHub is a system for management and sharing of OpenFLUID wares 
(simulators, observers, builder-extensions) and more.
It is mainly based on git, apache and php

OpenFLUID-WaresHub uses definitions sets for wares, in order to instantiate corresponding git repositories, setup apache based access control, and provide web reporting
